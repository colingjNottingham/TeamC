You will not work with the group until the end - the point of this task is that there is a clear definition (given below) of the \"interface format\" between your code and the data being produced by the other group's code. At the end of the day, you should be able to retrieve their file from GitHub and check whether your analysis works on it.\n",

You can check it works by putting your email adress in the \"Email\" column of your test file.
